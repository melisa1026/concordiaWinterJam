The game relies on the OnRoot method, where the Player character becomes a "real tree" in order to fool his enemies. Activating this method allows a camera shake, audio stopping, and no movement from the Player. 

There are different way to "die" in this game. This is activated when the Player fails to perform an action, rooting, when they touch the collider box linked to the enemies. This will lead to a specific animation sequence thanks to a system which checks which enemy found the Player then initialized the appropriate animation.


To play the game, you need the Standard Web Application (HTML5, Java, JavaScript, Flash) and access to the website itch.io.
